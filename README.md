# Link prediction (no more quantum walks lol)
Working repository for the science4cast competition.

I think the best managment would be to upload the code that we have now in the main branch and then everyone does his own individual branch and pushes to the main only when major and stable stuff are made.

# Competition submissions

Here is what we have submitted to the leaderboard:

- Bacalhau à Brás: the L3 method - performance: 0.86238699914634
- Bacalhau com Todos: the PA method - performance: 0.8971536961553
- Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá: combines L2 and PA - performance: 0.91073543787275 (L2 alone was slightly better than L3)
- Bacalhau à Lagareiro: combines L2 and PA with time weights - performance: 0.91777075300157
